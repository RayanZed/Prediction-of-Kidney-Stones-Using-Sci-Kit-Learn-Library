# Kidney Stone Prediction Classifier

## Overview

### *The Kidney Stone Prediction Classifier serves as a binary classification model crafted specifically to determine the likelihood of a patient having kidney stones. This model leverages a range of numerical features to make accurate predictions. Its primary purpose is to aid healthcare professionals in making well-informed decisions that lead to early detection and enhanced treatment outcomes.*

#### Dataset

The dataset used in training the model consists of 414 entries, with an additional separate test dataset containing 276 entries. This dataset encompasses a broad spectrum of information, including age, medical history, and other pertinent factors. The inclusion of such comprehensive data significantly contributes to the model's precision and reliability in making predictions related to kidney stones.

#### Code

Implemented in Python, the model codebase utilizes widely adopted libraries such as Pandas for efficient data manipulation and Scikit-learn for seamless integration of machine learning functionalities. The code is thoughtfully organized, ensuring ease of comprehension and facilitating potential customization for specific applications, benefitting both developers and healthcare practitioners.
